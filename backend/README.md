# Get Started

1. `npm i`

2. Create a file in the root folder titled `.env`

3. Find the SUPABASE_KEY environment key under Project Settings, `service_role` in Supabase and paste it inside the file above

4. Find the SUPABASE_URL under the settings and paste it in the same file

5. `npm run dev` - This command uses `nodemon` to hot reload the application on save

6. Visit <http://localhost:4000/api/projects>. If you see some JSON, the backend and database are good to go
